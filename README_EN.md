# HTools

HTools is an open-source tool directory platform powered by Cloudflare Pages Functions and D1, combining tool curation, article management, RSS aggregation, and Telegram message delivery—without a traditional server.

## Features

- **Tool directory**: category browsing, site-wide search, featured picks, and public tool submissions.
- **Content management**: articles and RSS subscription content in one dashboard, with Markdown support and conversion into site articles.
- **Telegram push**: send tools, articles, subscription items, and custom messages, then browse and update the records in one place.
- **GitHub integration**: read public repository details and auto-fill project metadata.
- **Workers AI** (optional): generate descriptions, summaries, and tags; convert common documents to Markdown.
- **ImgBed** (optional): upload images from the dashboard and fill in their public URLs automatically.
- **Data & experience**: full backup and restore, a public tool feed, Simplified Chinese / English interfaces, and light / dark themes.

## Deployment

1. Fork or import this repository into your GitHub account.
2. Create a Cloudflare Pages project and connect it to your repository.
3. Use these Pages build settings:

```txt
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: dist
```

4. Create a Cloudflare D1 database, for example `htools`.
5. Go back to the Pages project settings and add the `DB` binding listed under "Resource Bindings" below; add the `AI` binding as well if you want Workers AI.
6. Add the required variables to the Pages deployment environment using the environment-variable table below, and store every value marked as Secret as an encrypted variable.
7. Redeploy the Pages project.
8. Open `/admin` and sign in.

The D1 schema is initialized or upgraded automatically on first API access; no manual migration command is required. The database starts empty, so import the default source from the dashboard or add tools manually.

## Resource Bindings

Add these under **Settings → Bindings** in the Pages project. Bindings are not environment variables, so they take no value:

| Variable name | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DB` | Yes | D1 database | Select the D1 database you created; stores tools, articles, subscription content, and settings. |
| `AI` | No | Workers AI | Once bound, select a model and enable AI generation and document conversion under Admin > Service Settings. |

## Environment Variables

The application reads the following environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Recommended type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Secret | Admin password and session-signing secret; use a unique password of at least 12 characters. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | No | Secret | Raises the limit for admin-side public repository metadata requests. Use a read-only token without write, delete, or administration permissions; without it, the admin browser requests GitHub directly. |
| `IMGBED_TOKEN` | No | Secret | API token for [CloudFlare ImgBed](https://github.com/MarSeventh/CloudFlare-ImgBed). Grant only the `upload` permission, redeploy, then configure and enable the image bed under Admin > Service Settings. Uploads PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, or AVIF files up to 10 MB for tool previews, article covers, and Telegram push images. |
| `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | No; configure together with the secret key | Plain variable | Turnstile Site Key for the administrator login page; configure it together with the secret key. |
| `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` | No; configure together with the site key | Secret | Verifies Turnstile results on the server. Add the deployed domain, redeploy, then enable it in the dashboard. |
| `TGTOKEN` | No | Secret | Telegram Bot Token. After redeploying, set the recipient, test the connection, and enable it in the dashboard. Pushes are always triggered manually by an administrator. |

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For manual D1 initialization or troubleshooting:

```bash
npm run db:init:local
npm run db:init:remote
```

## Data Sources
